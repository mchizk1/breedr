\title{Standardizing Names.}
\usage{
nameR(names, str_ops = c("strip_ws", "upper", "shrink_ws"), na_val = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{Either a single string or a vector of character strings containing the
names of cultivars and/or breeding selections.}

\item{str_ops}{A character vector containing optional methods for string manipulation.
Possible options include: \cr
'strip_ws' (default) - Strip leading and trailing white space. \cr
'upper' (default) - Make all uppercase to eliminate case differences.\cr
'lower' - Make all lowercase to eliminate case differences.  Cannot be combined with 'upper'. \cr
'shrink_ws' (default) - remove duplicated white space from center of strings. \cr
NULL is acceptable to skip string manipulation}

\item{na_val}{An optional string indicating a value to be treated as missing.}
}
\value{
Either a single string or a vector of character strings containing the
standardized name replacements. Length will be equivalent to the length of
\code{names}.
}
\description{
\code{nameR} takes potentially inconsistent or erroneous names of
cultivars and breeding selections, and replaces them with standardized
alternatives. To minimize mismatched data or dropped entries, one could run
all occurrences of names through \code{nameR} prior to analysis.
