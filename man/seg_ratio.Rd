\title{Expected segregation ratios.}
\usage{
seg_ratio(parent1, parent2 = parent1, ploidy = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{parent1}{A character string or positive integer indicating the genotype of the first parent.  If
an integer is provided, ploidy must be provided as well.  If a character format is used, ploidy will
be inferred. Only biallelic SNPs are currently supported.}

\item{parent2}{A character string or positive integer indicating the genotype of the second parent.  Must be of
the same class as parent1. If not provided, assumed to be a self of parent1.}

\item{ploidy}{A positive integer indicating the ploidy level of the parents and progeny.  Only required if
parental genotypes are integers.}
}
\value{
A data.frame providing expected segregation ratios of progeny.
}
\description{
This function takes parental genotypes and projects expected segregation ratios of the progeny.
}
\examples{
seg_ratio("Aa", "AA")
seg_ratio(1, 2, 4)
seg_ratio("AAAaaa")
}
